	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/w10n_handler

	Fixed an issue with make check
	It failed when CppUnit was not present. Now those tests
	are ignored.

2015-03-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Rebuilt data/atomicTypes.nc as a netCDF4 file.
	This is a work around for an odd issue I'm blaming on the
	netcdf 4.1.1 rpm.

	Replaced the atomicTypes netCDF3 file with a netCDF4 version.
	This problem - the netcdf handler not reading integer variables
	from a netcdf 3 file - only shows up here with the file build
	using ncgen. Other netcdf3 files work fine. I'm blaming this on
	netcdf 4.1.1, which had some issues...

	Fix for	distclean and the modules build.

2015-03-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added 'pattern' test to w10n tests
	The test coads_SST_data.bescmd results in an (intentional) error. I
	added a Pattern rule to the *.at test file so that the build options,
	etc., will not make differences in the output that will make the test
	erroneously fail. I only modified one test to use the new rule; all
	tests pass on my version of the master branch.
